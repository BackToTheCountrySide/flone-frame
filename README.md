# Flone Frame 
This is the official repository of the airframe of [flone](http://flone.cc) quadcopter. 

Flone is an Free Libre Open Source drone ecosystem composed by physical hardware and software.

Some charateristics of this frame are:

* **Smart** - There is space for the camera to see, and you can use the rest of the sensors of the smartphone, like bluetooth, wifi, gps or 4G 

* **Compact** - Designed to be as small as possible but fully capable of carry an smartphone or sport camera.

* **Cheap** - Hard to found a drone frame cheaper than a piece of plywood of 30x30cm.

## Materials 
There are different materials to cut the frame, we recommend Plywood, but you can use other materials:

* **Plywood**: Natural & bio-degradable, very light, cheap and easy to obtain
Recommended thickness: 5mm.

* **MDF**: Natural & bio-degradable, cheap and easy to obtain. Litle bit more heavy.
Recommended thickness: 4mm.

* **Acrilic**: Solid, light but less resistant to impacts.
Recommended thickness: 3mm.

* **Acetal or Delrin**: Much more resistance to impacts, but expensive and hard to obtain.
Recommended thickness: 2mm.
   
## Getting Started
* Download the file of the thickness of your material.

* **Find out the thickness** - in order to make the frame as strong as possible is highly recomendable to cut a frame that fits the thickness of the material. Ask your distributor or mesure by yourself with a caliber.

* **Download the right file**  - select the file more close to the thickness of the material or download the parametric for match the exact size.  

* Check out the [Flone SVG Generator](http://frame.flone.cc) for assist you to select the file.
